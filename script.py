#https://github.com/kieferk/dfply/issues/86#issuecomment-533351436
# or on PC add it inside the following folder: PsychoPy3\Lib\site-packages; can also just download the folder from https://github.com/kieferk/dfply;
# once you have the dfply folder, you want to take its inner folder that is also called dfply and that's the folder to copy into psychopy's python directory
